# Sagemaker-ML-project
☁️ AWS SageMaker – Machine Learning Project
This repository showcases how to use AWS SageMaker for deploying machine learning models with real-world data. The project is based on a Bank Application, where I leverage AWS Free Tier services to manage and train machine learning models. It also includes an S3 bucket setup for storing and accessing data.

🚀 What This Repository Covers
AWS Free Tier Setup – Created an AWS Free Tier account to access SageMaker and other services for machine learning.
S3 Bucket – Setting up and managing an S3 bucket to store and manage datasets for the Bank Application project.
Machine Learning on AWS – Building, training, and deploying machine learning models using AWS SageMaker.
GitHub Integration – The repository is directly linked to AWS to automatically upload code and models to GitHub for version control and collaboration.
📂 Repository Overview
🔹 Bank Application Machine Learning Project – A real-world banking application where I applied machine learning models to predict customer behavior, loan approvals, or similar tasks.
🔹 AWS S3 Bucket – Storing datasets, models, and logs for easy access within AWS environment.
🔹 AWS SageMaker – Using SageMaker to train, deploy, and manage machine learning models.

🛠️ Technologies & Tools
AWS SageMaker – For model training, deployment, and managing machine learning workflows.
Amazon S3 – Storing datasets and models.
GitHub – Version control and integration with AWS for direct uploads.
Python – For data manipulation and model creation.
Machine Learning Algorithms – Applied to banking data for predictive analytics.
